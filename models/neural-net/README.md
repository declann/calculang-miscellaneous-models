`from-brain-xor.json` comes from console log in https://codesandbox.io/s/frosty-christian-4qciks?file=/src/index.js (the training doesn't happen in calculang now. We want it to be seemless to change this when I make a training model. I haven't focussed on this important structural point in this example yet.)

NN from first principles : totally crazy, but interesting.

Wrapping TensorFlow.js or other AI libraries is a smarter idea, but what value calculang modelling can add to inputs/outputs? Ideas = suggestion for [Work Declaratively](https://github.com/calculang/calculang/issues/47) example.
