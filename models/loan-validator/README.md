# calculang loan validator 🕵️

💭 *The goal here is to build a comprehensive tool that can be used to **scenario-out and validate** loans* 💳 *and mortgages* 🧱🏡

💭 *This may take an upload of payments and validate balances* ⚖️, *allowing for any refinancing* 🤝, *missed payments* ❌, *etc.*

💭 *Some of this might require detailed product-specifics about additional charges for instance* 🤯 *and **might warrant a two-way effort**. Thats ok!* 🤝☑️🌎

⚠️ *This validator/scenario tool isn't/won't be financial advice etc.*
